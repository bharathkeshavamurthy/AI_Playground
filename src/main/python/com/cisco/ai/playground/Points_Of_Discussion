Important points to discuss:

1. How do you propose we run our models - do we have a in-house GPU w/ CUDA, or do you suggest we use Google Cloud w/ Python?
2. Developed a next word prediction tool using LSTMs
3. Developed a text sequence generator using GRU
4 Kinds of regularization to employ - L1/L2, Dropout
5. Basic Text and Image classification
6. Basic Regression Modelling
7. TensorFlow Estimators and BoostedTrees
8. Basic Gradient Descent using pure TensorFlow
9. Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks for discrimination between real and generated handwritten images
10. Convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder for writing handwritten digits
11. Convolutional Neural Networks for Handwriting Recognition (recognize digits based on pixel values - classification)
